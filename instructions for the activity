Good day sir, you may find here the instructions for the Django activity.

1. Initialize VENV and manage.py
2. Product list may be found in http://localhost:8000/products/
3. Each inputted item has add-able stock levels
3. Afterwards, you may click the navbar to navigate to 'Order'
4. In Order page, inputting a single order of an item subtracts the quantity from the stock levels indicated in the products page. 
5. Inputting a quantity beyond the stock level amount will result to a message indicating insufficient stocks.
